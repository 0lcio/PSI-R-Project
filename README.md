# Ciclismo Decathlon Milano - Assistenza e Riparazioni

This repository contains an analysis of the sales and revenue data for Decathlon Milano's Cycling Department, specifically focusing on the **Assistance and Repairs** section for the year 2023. The goal of the analysis is to evaluate whether expanding this section would lead to increased revenues and if it's a viable business strategy.

## Project Overview

This project was developed for the **Probability and Statistics** course of the Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** at **University of Milano-Bicocca**. The analysis involves comparing the sales and revenue performance of **Assistance and Repairs** with other departments, including bicycle sales (Trekking, MTB, and Road). Key steps in the analysis include:

- Visualizing sales and revenue data through histograms.
- Calculating statistical measures (mean, median, quartiles, etc.) for each department.
- Performing a linear regression to assess the relationship between sales and revenue for the **Assistance and Repairs** department.
- Making recommendations based on data-driven insights.
